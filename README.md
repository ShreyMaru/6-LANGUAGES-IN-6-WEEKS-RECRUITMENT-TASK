# 6-LANGUAGES-IN-6-WEEKS-RECRUITMENT-TASK

I have used C++ for the assignment.
I found a code online in which two tasks were being executed simultaneously using multithreading. Thus, I decided to use that format in my code.
Task 1 is for counting a time period of 1 sec whereas Task 2 is for running the loop. 

I was unable to compile the code on my system due to some MinGW problem. Hence, I am unable to produce the executable file. I have tested the code on an online compiler.
